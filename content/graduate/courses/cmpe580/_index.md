## Catalog Description

Many of our behavior patterns are key determinants of important health outcomes. Positive health effects can be achieved when indicators of an individual’s lifestyle and behavior are maintained within healthy ranges.

Personal electronic health assistants support health and wellness in everyday life.  
This lecture provides an introduction to such systems by combining relevant methods, tools, and practical applications from both research and industry.

Covered methods include physiological signal processing, data privacy techniques, and relevant approaches from machine learning and data mining.

Applications include personal stress assistants, ambient assisted living, and smartphone-based health assistance systems.

No special requirements are needed to attend this course; all necessary background knowledge is introduced within the lectures.
