## Catalog Description

Wearable computers align with Mark Weiser’s vision of technologies that become woven into everyday life.  
This course introduces wearable computing by integrating methods, tools, and practical applications from research and industry.

Methods include wearable and ambient sensor data processing, basic statistical techniques, and machine learning and data mining approaches.

Applications cover activity recognition in daily life, human emotion detection, social signal processing, and the smartphone as a wearable computing device.

There are no special requirements to attend this lecture.
