All students enrolled in the Computer Engineering program are assigned an
academic advisor, who is a full-time faculty member within the department. These
advisors play a crucial role in providing guidance and support to students on a
wide range of issues, including adjustment to university life, academic
direction, and career planning.

Academic advisors are responsible for monitoring the courses students register
for and approving their academic schedules. It's important to note that course
registration is only considered finalized once it receives approval from the
student's advisor.

Below is the current list of academic advisors for the Computer Engineering
undergraduate program.

## Graduate Studies

Thesis advisors assume the role of academic advisors for graduate students
within the context of their studies. However, in cases where graduate students
do not have assigned thesis advisors, the Graduate Studies coordinator may
fulfill the role of academic advisor. This ensures that all graduate students
receive necessary support and guidance throughout their academic journey,
whether related to their thesis research or other academic matters.
