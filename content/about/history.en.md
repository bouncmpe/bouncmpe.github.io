Founded in 1982, the Department of Computer Engineering has played a leading role in shaping technological advancement in Turkey. The department's undergraduate program, designed to meet the rigorous standards of the IEEE/ACM Joint Curriculum Committee, graduated its first graduates in 1986. That same year, the department expanded its offerings with the launch of MS and PhD programs in Computer Engineering.

## Milestones of Growth

1976
: The groundwork for computer education is laid with the establishment of a Computer Science graduate program within the Faculty of Arts & Sciences.

1982
: The Department of Computer Engineering is established within the Faculty of Engineering, marking a significant step towards specialized computer education. The department's commitment to quality is evident from the outset, with the undergraduate program designed to meet the standards set by the IEEE/ACM Joint Curriculum Committee. To focus resources on this new program, admissions for the Computer Science program are temporarily paused.

1986
: The department celebrates its first graduating class in the Computer Engineering undergraduate program. Recognizing the growing need for advanced degrees, the department launches MS and PhD programs in Computer Engineering.

1988
: Reflecting its rapid development, the department moves to a new home in the "Educational Technology Building" This move facilitates not only research and education within Computer Engineering but also allows the department to expand its services to the entire university. This includes offering computer literacy education and associated PC laboratory services:

- Five PC laboratories with a total of 60 computers, including a pilot classroom for Computer-Aided Education.
- Educational laboratories focused on Software Engineering and Computer Hardware.
- Research laboratories dedicated to Artificial Intelligence, Computer-Aided Design, and Robotics.
- A minicomputer laboratory with a 7-terminal PDP 11/23 minicomputer.

1992
: Demonstrating its commitment to continuous improvement, both undergraduate and graduate programs are revised to adhere to the latest guidelines published by the IEEE/ACM Joint Curriculum Committee. Additionally, service courses are reorganized to enhance their effectiveness. The department flourishes, reaching a total enrollment of 360 students, including 57 graduate students.

1998
: The department achieves a significant milestone with international accreditation by the ABET board, a testament to the high quality of its educational programs.

2003
: The Software Engineering MSc program is launched to address the growing industry demand for software professionals. This program provides an opportunity for four-year graduates to refine their skills and acquire the necessary expertise for successful careers in software engineering.

2004
: The department successfully renews its ABET accreditation, demonstrating its ongoing commitment to maintaining its exceptional standards.

2006
: The "Educational Technology Building" undergoes modernization and reinforcement to enhance earthquake safety. Following these renovations, the department, now boasting 19 full-time and 8 part-time faculty members along with 21 research and teaching assistants, returns to its renovated building.

2010, 2016 & 2022
: The department's commitment to excellence is further solidified with successful renewals of its ABET accreditation.
