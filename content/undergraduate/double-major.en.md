## Overview

A double major program enables Boğaziçi University students to concurrently
obtain two separate undergraduate diplomas for two separate undergraduate
programs.

[**Double Major Programs Directive**](http://bogazici.edu.tr/tr_TR/Content/Ogrenciler/Ogrenci_Isleri/Yonetmelik_ve_Ic_Tuzukler/Cift_Anadal_Programlari_Yonergesi) at Boğaziçi University encompasses
provisions regarding student admissions and registration procedures for double
major programs conducted at Boğaziçi University, as well as regulations
pertaining to the implementation of double major program practices. You can
check the directive on the University's page.

Specifically, Article 7 of the directive lists the university-wide minimum
admission requirements. It's important to note that departments may impose
additional, program-specific requirements for double major applicants.

The comprehensive list of university-wide double major programs can be found on
[**this page**](http://bogazici.edu.tr/tr-TR/Content/Akademik/Cift_Anadal_Programlari).

departments must fulfill all requirements of the Computer Engineering program.
Within the Computer Engineering curriculum, it is required that three out of the
six CC electives are computer engineering (CMPE) courses. The remaining three CC
elective slots can also (optionally) be satisfied by courses taken in the Double
Major program ---provided they are in
[the CC courses list](undergraduate/electives) of the Computer Engineering
program. Please check the web pages of Mathematics, Physics, and Industrial
Engineering departments for further information.
