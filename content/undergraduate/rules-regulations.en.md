    <li>SPA: Semester point average.</li>
    <li>Probationary student: Student with GPA<2.00.</li>
    <li>Repeating status: Student with GPA<2.00 and SPA<2.00 for two consecutive terms.</li>
    <li>Legal maximum duration: 14 terms excluding the time spent in the English preparatory program (10 terms for Double Major students).</li>
    <li>Graduation credit: 145 credits.</li>
    <li>Average term credit: Regardless of the term, 18.1 credits (graduation credit / number of terms in the course program; 145 / 8)</li>
    <li>Senior student: Those who have completed 108 credits (3/4 of the total graduation credits) student.</li>
    <li>Department Board Approval: Obtaining the approval of the Department Board (the faculty members in the department) on a matter related to the student's registration. In such a case, the student must fill out a petition (e-petition) via the OBIKAS system, explaining the reason for their request. The petition is decided in accordance with the opinions of the advisor and the department.</li>
    <li>Administrative Board Approval: Obtaining the approval of the Faculty of Engineering's Executive Board (the faculty members serving on the Executive Board) on a matter related to the student's registration. In such a case, the student must fill out a petition (e-petition) via the OBIKAS system, explaining the reason for their request. After the petition is evaluated by the advisor and the department head, it will be sent to the Faculty of Engineering. The petition is decided at the first Administrative Board meeting that follows.</li>
</ul>

## 1. Completion of Registration

<ol type="a">
    <li>During the registration period for a new term, during the add/drop period or withdrawal period, after the course program is prepared on the computer, it must be sent for advisor approval and it should not be forgotten that the registration is not completed until the advisor approves. (For example, if the student thinks that the registration is complete after sending the registration for approval and does not follow up on the computer, the registration will be incomplete if the advisor rejects the registration and sends it back to the student for correction.) The advisor may find some incompletion or errors in the course program and may reject the program and send it back to the student for correction. It may take time for the student to correct the program and send it back for advisor approval, for the advisor to review it again and approve or reject it, etc. Therefore, it is recommended that the course program be completed and sent for advisor approval before the last day of registration. Otherwise, if the program is still not approved after the registration deadline, the student will be considered late and will need to pay an additional registration fee.</li>
    <li>If the approval of the Department Board or the Administrative Board is required in addition to the approval of the advisor regarding a matter related to the student's registration, the student must state their request in a petition.</li>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>If the petition can be decided before the registration deadline, the result of the petition must be awaited, and the course schedule must be prepared according to this result (whether the request is accepted or not) and sent for the advisor's approval.</li>
            <li>If the petition cannot be decided until after the registration deadline, the student must prepare a normal course schedule without taking into account the request in the petition and send it for the advisor's approval (otherwise, the student will be considered late). If the request in the petition is accepted later, the necessary changes in the course program will be made by the advisor or the Administrative Board by contacting the Registrar's Office.</li>
        </ol>
</ol>

## 2. General Rules

<ol type="a">
    <li>When preparing the course program, the student should be careful not to have any conflicts between course hours. In necessary cases, a small number of conflicts that would not affect the education can be allowed. In this case, the student should also make the necessary explanations when sending the course program for the approval of the advisor. A program with conflicts should not be sent for approval without any explanation; such a program will be rejected.</li>
    <li>When preparing the course program, the student should follow the order in the department's course program. For example, a course from the fifth semester should not be taken without taking a course from the fourth semester. Any disruption of the order due to a valid excuse is subject to the approval of the advisor. In this case, approval should be obtained by speaking with the advisor.</li>
    <li>Courses not included in the course program cannot be taken for credit. Such a course can be taken non-credit if desired. Non-credit courses cannot be converted to credited later.</li>
    <li>Students in their first two terms receive a package program; in other words, they must take all courses of the current term when they are first offered (except for the exception in 2.f).</li>
    <li>A student cannot drop (add/drop) or withdraw from the compulsory courses of the first two terms, regardless of the term (except for the exception in 2.f). They can drop or withdraw from non-compulsory courses (for example, a course taken without credit).</li>
    <li>Second-term students who start their education in the second term (spring term) of the academic year and complete their first term with a GPA>=2.75 can take another required course instead of a course in their package program with the approval of their advisor. If the courses to be changed are EC or HSS, the GPA>=2.75 condition is not required. The change of position can only be made for one course in the package program.</li>
    <li>For Cmpe150-Cmpe160-Cmpe250 courses, DD and DC courses cannot be repeated by changing the course order. In other words, if the student has passed Cmpe160, they cannot repeat Cmpe150; if they has passed Cmpe250, they cannot repeat Cmpe150 and Cmpe160 courses. (This article does not apply to students with failed status.)</li>
    <li>A course with an F grade must be repeated when it is first offerred. If the student does not repeat the course when it is first offered due to a valid excuse, it is subject to the approval of the Administrative Board.</li>
    <li>A student cannot withdraw from a course they has repeated because they has received an F. A student's withdrawal from a course due to a valid excuse is subject to the approval of the Administrative Board.</li>
    <li>When an elective course (HSS or CC) is graded F, the same course can be repeated or another course from the same elective group can be taken with an R (repeat) mark instead.</li>
    <li>A student can repeat a maximum of six courses from which they received a DD or DC grade during their education period. A maximum of one DD or DC course can be repeated in a semester. Such a course must be repeated within four semesters after the course was taken.</li>
    <li>In a course repeated due to an F, DD or DC grade, the last grade received is valid. The previous grade loses its validity, but it appears on the transcript.</li><li>
    <li>A student takes the E exam of a course for which they received an E grade. The letter grade for the course becomes DD if they pass the exam, and F if they fail. Students who pass the E exam cannot be given a grade higher than DD.</li>
    <li>Undergraduate students cannot take 6xx coded courses at all.</li>
    <li>Only students who are seniors and have a GPA>=2.50 can take 5xx coded courses.</li>
    <li>Compulsory courses in the department program cannot be taken from outside Boğaziçi University when they are first taken, except within the scope of the exchange program.</li>
    <li>In case of an error in the letter grade of a course, the grade correction can be made no later than one week before the start date of the registration period for the following semester (for example, a grade given in a course in the 2nd semester of 2013-2014 can only be changed one week before the first day of registration for the 1st semester of 2014-2015 (approximately, the beginning of September 2014)). In this case, the relevant instructor notifies the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering of the grade change with a petition.</li>
    <li>A maximum of 10 credit courses or 3 courses (for example, 3 courses with 4 credits) can be taken during the summer term.</li>
    <li>A TK / HTR course can be given as the 4th course to students who will be eligible to graduate at the end of the summer term, with the decision of the Administrative Board.</li>
    <li>A student can withdraw from a course a maximum of five times during the undergraduate education, a maximum of two during the summer terms and a maximum of three during the regular terms.</li>
    <li>Senior students cannot take 1xx coded courses other than HSS and CC courses.</li>
    <li>If two of the 1-credit Lab courses offered by the departments of the Faculty of Engineering are taken at the same time, they are accepted as a department course load.</li>
    <li>Students who have completed all the courses they are required to take in their program and have only internship deficiencies must submit their internship registrations to the Faculty Administrative Board at the time of registration (until the end of the course add/drop period). to open a program (BUIS, e-petition) and register, and students who have completed their legal student period must pay their fees.</li>
    <li>The maximum period for completing course substitution/change procedures for courses taken at another higher education institution is until the end of the registration period of the semester following the semester in which the student was placed in the program.</li>
</ol>

## 3. Taking Extra Courses

<ol type="a">
    <li>A student must normally take as many courses as the number of courses in the current semester or the average semester credit. Exceeding this number of courses or semester credits is considered extra courses.</li>
    <li>Students with a GPA>=3.00 may take one extra course, and senior students with a GPA>=2.00 may take one extra course in the last two semesters in order to graduate, with the approval of their advisors. Double major students and minor program students with a GPA>=3.00 may take two extra courses with the approval of their advisors and the Department Board.</li>
    <li>Students with 2.50<=GPA<3.00 may take one extra course with the approval of the Department Board.</li>
    <li>Students with 2.00<=GPA<2.50 may take one extra course or senior students with GPA>=2.00 may take two extra courses in order to graduate with the approval of the Administrative Board.</li>
    <li>Regardless of the term or status, the number of extra courses may not exceed 2 courses or 8 more than the average term credit; it may never exceed this.</li>
    <li>Students transferring from outside the university cannot take extra courses in their first term.</li>
    <li>Students may not take extra courses in their first term.</li>
    <li>Students in the second term who have completed all their courses and have a GPA>=3.00 may take one extra course with the approval of their advisor and the Administrative Board.</li>
</ol>

## 4. Taking Sub Courses

<ol type="a">
    <li>​A student should normally take the same number of courses as the current semester or the average semester credits. Taking less than this number of courses or semester credits is considered sub courses.</li>
    <li>A student's ability to reduce their course load to 15 credits is subject to the approval of their advisor. In this case, the reason for wanting to take fewer courses should be explained to the advisor and should be approved. In very special cases, a student can reduce their course load to 13 credits with the approval of their advisor.</li>
    <li>A student's ability to reduce their course load to 11 credits is subject to the approval of the Administrative Board (except for the exceptions in 4.d and 4.e). In order for this to be allowed, there must be a significant personal illness. In very special cases, a student can reduce their course load to 9 credits with the approval of the Administrative Board.</li>
    <li>The minimum credit load (15 credits) rule does not apply to students in their senior year status. Students can reduce their course load to 11 credits with the approval of their advisor, or less than 11 credits with the approval of the Administrative Board.</li>
    <li>Since repeating students can take limited courses, students in this situation can reduce their course load to 11 credits with the approval of their advisor; the approval of the Administrative Board is not required.</li>
    <li>During the course withdrawal period, students can reduce their course load to 12 credits (in the form of 4 courses of 3 credits; excluding TK / HTR courses) or 13 credits by withdrawing from a course with the approval of their advisor. Senior students and repeating students are not subject to this rule; articles 4.d and 4.e are applied to these students.</li>
    <li>Except for students who are in senior status, no less than 11 credits can be taken.
</ol>

## 5. Repeating Students

<ol type="a">
    <li>Repeating students cannot take more credit than the average semester credit. In addition to repeating F, they can repeat DD and DC courses and/or take a maximum of two new courses, not exceeding the average semester credit. In the summer term, in addition to repeating F, DD and DC, they can take a maximum of two new courses, not exceeding a total of 10 credits or 3 courses.</li>
    <li>Students with a repeating status who have completed 3/4 of their total graduation credits or are in the last two semesters of their legal maximum term are not subject to the limitation specified in 5.a. These students may exceed the average semester credit (10 credits if it is a summer term) or take more than two new courses.</li>
    <li>Courses taken from another university as a special student while in repeating status cannot be counted as credit.</li>
</ol>

## 6. Probationary Students

<ol type="a">
    <li>​Students in probationary status cannot take more courses.</li>
    <li>Students in probationary status who have completed 3/4 of their total graduation credits or are in the last two semesters of their legal maximum term are not subject to the limitation specified in 6.a. These students can take more courses.</li>
</ol>

## 7. CC Courses

<ol type="a">
    <li> ​CC courses (Complementary Elective) are complementary technical courses that are not directly included in Computer Engineering subjects, but are related to various subjects of the Computer Engineering discipline.</li>
    <li>CC courses that can be taken consist of departmental CC courses and non-departmental CC courses. Departmental CC courses are courses with the code CmpE4xx in the curriculum (except CmpE443, CmpE451, CmpE491, CmpE492). The list of non-departmental CC courses can be accessed from the CmpE CC Courses page (or by following the "Undergraduate" and "Complementary Courses" links on the department's homepage).</li>
    <li>Students must take one of the courses specified in 7.b as a CC course. If a student wants to take a non-departmental CC course, but wants to take a course that is not on the non-departmental CC course list but that they thinks is a CC course, they should talk to their advisor. If the advisor also thinks that the course can be a CC course, they will ask the HSS/CC Committee via e-mail. If this committee gives a positive opinion, the result will be notified to the student and the course will be added to their record and the course will be added to the CC course list.will be added to the ine.</li>
    <li>At least three of the six CC courses that must be taken in the fourth year must be CmpE courses (i.e., a maximum of three can be courses outside the CmpE department). There is no upper limit for the number of CmpE courses; if desired, all six can be CmpE courses, and no courses from outside the department can be taken. The restrictions of the courses specified in the CmpE CC Courses list must be followed (e.g., a maximum of one course with the codes AD, ENG, ECON can be taken).</li>
    <li>A student can take Cmpe491 instead of a CC course to do a project for two semesters. Only those with GPA>=2.00 can take Cmpe491. Students with GPA<2.00 can take Cmpe491 course with the approval of the Department Board.</li>
    <li>Only students who are seniors and have GPA>=2.50 can take 5xx coded courses.</li>
</ol>

## 8. HSS Courses

<ol type="a">
    <li>HSS courses (Humanities and Social Sciences - Social Elective) are social content courses that aim to bring students into contact with social issues as well as the technical issues of Computer Engineering.</li>
    <li>You can select the HSS courses that can be taken from this list.</li>
</ol>

## 9. Taking Courses from Other Departments

<ol type="a">
    <li>Courses given by the School of Applied Sciences cannot be taken for credit.</li>
</ol>

## 10. Graduation

<ol type="a">
    <li>A minimum of 145 credits must be completed to graduate from the department.</li>
    <li>In order to graduate, the education must be completed with a minimum GPA of 2.00 within the legal maximum period.</li>
    <li>In order to graduate, all courses taken with or without credit must be passed.</li>
    <li>Students with a GPA>2.00 who cannot fulfill the graduation requirements because they received an F in only one course may be given the opportunity to take an exam or do an academic study that will replace it, after receiving the opinion of the relevant instructor. The maximum grade given for this exam is DD. In case of failure, the course must be repeated.</li>
</ol>

## 11. Exchange Program

<ol type="a">
    <li>Students of our Faculty who go to “Exchange and Erasmus” cannot repeat their “DD” and “DC” courses. They can only repeat ‘F’ courses with the approval of the course instructor, advisor and department.</li>
    <li>The transfer procedures of courses taken by students participating in exchange programs at other institutions can be done by the end of the add/drop period of the semester following the semester they return from the exchange program.</li>
</ol>

## 12. Double Major Program

<ol type="a">
    <li>Students who want to enter the Double Major Program, provided that they have a GPA>3.00 and have successfully completed all their courses, must apply to the Faculty Administrative Board at the beginning of the 3rd semester at the earliest and at the beginning of the 5th semester at the latest. Other aspects of the Double Major program are specified in the Double Major regulations.</li>
    <li>The double major program must be completed in 10 semesters at the latest. A maximum of one semester spent in exchange programs will not be counted towards this period.</li>
