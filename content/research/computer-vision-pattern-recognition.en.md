Computer vision and pattern recognition involve the development of algorithms and systems that can interpret and understand visual information from the world. This field combines techniques from artificial intelligence, machine learning, and image processing to enable machines to recognize patterns, objects, and activities in images and videos. Applications range from autonomous vehicles and medical imaging to surveillance and robotics.

The researchers working on computer vision and pattern recognition are:
