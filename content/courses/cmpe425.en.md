## Catalog Description

Overview of the compilation process. Lexical analysis, regular expressions, finite automata and lexical analyzer generators. Symbol tables. Grammars. Top-down and bottom-up syntax analysis. Recursive-descent. SLR, canonical LR, LALR and operator precedence parsing techniques. Parser generators. Semantic analysis and attribute grammers. Abstract machines ad intermediate code. Syntax directed translation schemes. Implementation of a compiler for a simple imperative language.

## Course Learning Outcome

- Understand the process of compilation and the components of a compiler
- Comprehend the relationship between high-level programming languages and their realization as machine instructions
- Gain knowledge of lexical analysis and parsing, along with their implementation strategies
- Acquire the skills to design and implement compilers for simple imperative languages
- Utilize tools such as lex, yacc, and LLVM in the construction of compilers
