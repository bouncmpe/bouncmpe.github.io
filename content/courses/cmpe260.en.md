## Catalog Description

This course is intended to introduce the student to the main paradigms of computation, languages representative of these paradigms, techniques of implementing various programming language constructs, as well as basic concepts relating to the specification of programming languages.Syntax and semantics of programming languages, basic constructs that are common to all languages (control structures, subprograms, etc.), and basic programming paradigms (functional, logic, etc.) will be covered. The intent of the course is not teaching a specific programming language; instead, using several languages to exemplify the main concepts and constructs.

## Course Learning Outcome
- Identify and describe the fundamental elements of programming languages.
- Understand different programming paradigms and their implementations.
- Evaluate and select the most appropriate programming paradigm for different problems.
- Demonstrate the ability to write programs using multiple programming paradigms.
- Understand the inner workings of code execution
