## Catalog Description

- Analysis of computer science algorithms: Sorting, searching, paging and parallelism.
- Analysis of mathematical algorithms: games and puzzles, network algorithms, and probabilistic algorithms.

## Course Learning Outcomes

This course is intended to introduce the student to the main paradigms of algorithm analysis, methods and
mathematical tools used for analyzing the performance of algorithms, the theory of parallel algorithms, as well as
known sequential and parallel algorithmic solutions to frequently encountered problems.
The theory of complexity analysis, basic techniques that are commonly used in analyzing the performance, basic
classes of algorithms (comparison-based, recursive, divide-and-conquer, dynamic, greedy, numerical, graph), and
lower bound theory will be covered. Parallel architectures and parallel algorithms will be studied in detail. Meanwhile,
mathematical tools like interpolation, master theorem, etc. will be introduced. The last part of the course will be the
study of the topic of probabilistic algorithms, which is a rapidly growing area of research.
