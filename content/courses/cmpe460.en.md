## Catalog Description

Computer Graphics deals with the synthesis of images from geometric models and textures; which may be acquired form the real world or may be synthetically generated as well. The course will focus on modeling; which is the geometric description of 3D scenes; and rendering, which creates realistic images from such models.  An important component of the course is the use of mathematics. The course uses linear algebra, and other areas of math. We will review mathematical basics used in the course. Programming experience in C++ and a basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra is assumed. Apart from the lecture topics listed below, some OpenGL programming will also be covered.

## Course Learning Outcomes

- To understand the working of the rendering pipeline in a modern computer.
- To apply linear algebra to model graphical primitives.
- To design a ray tracer and implement it.
- To understand the use of geometric models to represent curves and surfaces in 3D.
- To understand more advanced rendering techniques.
