Professor Akarun and her research team have been granted computing hours through **EuroHPC**, the European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking. In a recent interview, she discusses how access to supercomputers has propelled her research forward and explores the potential of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to make interactions with public services more seamless for the **Deaf community**.

In the interview, Professor Akarun explains:

> Access to the EuroHPC infrastructure enables us to carry our research to a different level. Large language models have revolutionised the whole field of machine learning, but they are very costly to train and even fine-tune. With our previous supercomputing resources, training would take weeks or months, and we would exceed our allocated quotas before the models converged. Therefore, before the access now granted to us by EuroHPC, this kind of work would be out of the question.
